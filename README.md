👋 Hi, I'm Sharanya V

🚀 Aspiring Data Engineer | Python • SQL • MySQL | Open to Remote Work (WFH)

I’m a software engineer transitioning into Data Engineering, building real-world data pipelines using Python and SQL.
My backend development experience helps me design reliable, production-style data workflows and understand end-to-end systems.

💼 Previous Experience (Backend / Software Development)

🏢 Tata Consultancy Services, Chennai – Backend Developer (1.5 years)

🏢 Solartis Technology Pvt Ltd, Madurai – Software Developer (2 years

🏢 Success4 Pvt Ltd, Bangalore (Remote) – Contract Role (4 months)

Strong foundation in backend systems, databases, and production engineering practices — now applying this to Data Engineering pipelines.

🧠 Currently Upskilling in Data Engineering

🔹 Python for Data Engineering (ETL, file handling, pipelines)

🔹 SQL for Analytics & Transformations

🔹 Building End-to-End Data Pipelines (CSV → MySQL → Cleaning → Aggregation → JSON Export)

🔹 Data Quality Checks, Idempotent Pipelines, Error Handling

🔹 Basics of Cloud & Scalable Data Systems (learning phase)
